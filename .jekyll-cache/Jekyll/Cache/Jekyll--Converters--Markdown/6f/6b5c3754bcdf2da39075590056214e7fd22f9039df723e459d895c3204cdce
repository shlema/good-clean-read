<p>Iâ€™ve been covering technology, startups, and everything in between for print and online media for over 15 years. Journalistic commissioned stories, profiles, company website copy, guest columns, reviews, and everything in between â€” Iâ€™ve written it all, and happy to do it again. In addition to that, Proceed.to can offer editing of written pieces to make the copy as clean and concise as possible.</p>
