## Media and content services — from <br /> growing in-house editorial teams <br /> to creating content strategies

Hi, I'm Andrii Degeler, a media leader and journalist with 15+ years of experience in covering the European technology industry. **Proceed.to >** is the storefront for all things I do for work.

In my most recent role as the Head of Media at [TNW](https://thenextweb.com) (a Financial Times company), I'd led a cross-functional team of six people to make TNW Media into a noticeable presence in the European tech media landscape, covering hard technology stories to inform the audience of startups, investors, corporate innovators, and policy makers across the continent.

I'm happy to support organisations in stepping up their media effort, from the perspective of comms and media strategy, business planning, team building, as well as hands-on content production. See the outline of my services below, and [set up a call](#contact) to discuss your needs!

### <a name="media"></a> Building in-house media

I'm passionate about and experienced in building, launching, and growing editorial teams in both media and corporate environments. I strongly believe in the power of thoroughly crafted content — be it writing, podcasts, or video — to engage people and deliver the most important messages. 

At the time when more and more content we interact with is produced by (generative) AI, it's more important than ever to have a team of competent human beings to tell your story and connect to the audience that's important for you.

### <a name="strategy"></a> Content strategy

Thanks to my experience in journalism and communications, Proceed.to can lead or support the process of creation, adjustment, and implementation of an organisation’s content strategy. From determining the goals and target audience to the actual content design and planning, Proceed.to is well-positioned to oversee, create, and execute on content strategies. 

### <a name="writing"></a> Writing

I've been covering technology, startups, and everything in between for print and online media for over 15 years. Journalistic commissioned stories, profiles, company website copy, guest columns, reviews, and everything in between — [I've written it all](https://www.clippings.me/shlema), and will happily to do it again. In addition to that, Proceed.to can offer editing of written pieces to make the copy as clean and concise as possible. 

### <a name="podcasting"></a> Podcasting

I've co-hosted, produced, recorded, and edited the [Tech.eu Podcast](https://podcast.tech.eu/) from 2018 to 2021 and the [TNW Podcast](https://podcast.thenextweb.com/) throughout 2024. This gave me wealth of experience in hosting a show, including writing episode scripts, interviewing guests, and assessing the final tracks. 

Proceed.to can lead or support the whole life cycle of podcast creation, from the initial idea to episode planning and scripting, including all the nitty-gritty of choosing the hosting and managing artwork and other collateral. I can also lead the recording process with professional-grade audio equipment, as well as take care of audio editing. 

In addition to that, Proceed.to can oversee (as well as provide hands-on support for) the podcast distribution process. That includes creating unique content for social media, engaging show notes and descriptions, and even audio ads and teasers to run on other shows. 

### <a name="speaking"></a> Speaking

Over the years, I’ve taken the stage at technology conferences dozens of times to discuss topics like the future of media, startup ecosystems, PR and media communications for startups, and much more.

As a professional journalist, podcast host, and experienced public speaker, I’m often asked to interview technology leaders on stage and moderate panel discussions. I’ve been fortunate to share the stage with the bright minds representing the likes of NATO, Microsoft, Y Combinator, Adyen, Red Hat, and many more.

I’m open to invitations to events related to the (European) technology ecosystem in the capacity of a speaker, moderator, or stage host. [Here's an outline](https://shlema.me/speaking/) of the ways I can add value to your event.
